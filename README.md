# SpringBootProject
A complete Spring Boot project featuring AOP for cross-cutting concerns, a layered architecture with service and controller components, global error handling, DTO-based input validation, and unit testing with JUnit/Mockito. Designed following best practices for clean and maintainable code.

This is a comprehensive Spring Boot project designed to demonstrate a well-structured and modular backend application. It includes essential components and best practices commonly used in enterprise-grade Java applications.

‚úÖ Key Features:
Spring Boot Framework: Leverages the simplicity and power of Spring Boot for rapid backend development.

AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Implements cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and performance monitoring without cluttering the business logic.

Service Layer: Follows clean architecture by separating business logic from controller and data access layers.

Error Handling: Robust global exception handling using @ControllerAdvice to return meaningful error responses.

Input Validation: Uses DTOs and validation annotations (@Valid) to handle and validate user input cleanly and safely.

Unit Testing: Includes unit tests for key components using JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
